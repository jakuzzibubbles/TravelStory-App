#### **Objectives**
1. Successfully deploy the frontend and backend of the travel app to a cloud service.
2. Ensure the application is accessible with minimal downtime during deployment.
3. Configure the cloud environment for optimal performance and security.
4. Implement monitoring and logging for ongoing performance tracking.

#### **Scope**
- **In Scope**:
  - Deployment of frontend UI to a cloud hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
  - Deployment of backend API to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
  - Configuration of environment variables for different environments.
  - Implementation of monitoring tools for app performance.
  - Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
  
- **Out of Scope**:

|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Epic 1: Deploy frontend                   | Set up the frontend on Vercel (or a similar service) and ensure it connects to the backend API. | Developer / DevOps     | To Do       | 5            | Frontend is deployed successfully and accessible via a public URL. |
| Epic 2: Deploy backend                    | Deploy the backend API to AWS (using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2) or Heroku, ensuring proper configuration. | Developer / DevOps     | To Do       | 6            | Backend is deployed successfully and connects to the MongoDB Atlas cluster. |
| Epic 3: Configure environment variables    | Set up necessary environment variables for the frontend and backend (e.g., API keys, database URLs). | Developer / DevOps     | To Do       | 3            | Environment variables are correctly set and the app functions as expected in the cloud environment. |
| Epic 4: Implement monitoring              | Set up monitoring tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, LogRocket) to track app performance and errors in the cloud environment. | DevOps                 | To Do       | 4            | Monitoring is in place, and logs are accessible for debugging and performance tracking. |
| Epic 5: Set up CI/CD pipeline             | Configure a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Jenkins) to automate the deployment process for both frontend and backend. | DevOps                 | To Do       | 5            | CI/CD pipeline is functional and deploys changes automatically on merge to the main branch. |
| Task 6: User acceptance testing           | Organize user testing sessions to gather feedback on the deployed application.                     | Tester                  | To Do       | 3            | Gather feedback and report on user experience with the new features. |
